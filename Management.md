## Election Procedure
- Prior to any election, the Spokesperson (or their designate, if they wish to stand for election) will appoint a Chair of a Nominating Committee. This Chair will then form a Nominating Committee. Nominations will be called for by the Nomination Committee from all EIC-Canada Investigators. Any member of EIC-Canada may nominate any other member, including themselves.
- In the first round all candidates including the Incumbent Candidate (IC), if standing, are on the ballot. If a candidate other than the IC has an overall majority, or if the IC has a 2/3 majority then they are elected.
- If no one is elected in the first round then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is removed from the ballot for a next round of voting. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a coin toss will be used to decide who is removed from the ballot. This procedure is repeated until a candidate is elected or there is a final vote with just two candidates on the ballot. In the event of a tie in a runoff between the two candidates, the voting is redone. In the event of a second tie in a runoff between the two candidates, a coin toss will be used to decide who is elected.
